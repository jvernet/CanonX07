## Introduction

This project is all about keeping the Canon X‑07 alive and kicking. Back in the early ’80s, this little portable computer gave people the chance to dive into BASIC and assembly programming.

What we’re doing here:

- Gathering code, tips, and tricks for programming the X‑07.
- Preserving old manuals and guides (most of them only exist in French).
- Sharing knowledge so today’s retro‑computing fans can enjoy the machine just like the original community did.

Think of this as a mix between a resource hub and a tribute.

RPUFOS is a French group, but everyone is welcome to join and contribute.\
For now, all the content is written in French.
